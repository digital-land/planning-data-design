    <p class="govuk-body">Our data design process is split into stages.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Having specific stages improves the visibility of our progress. We want to make it easy to see where a planning consideration is in our process and what we need to do to make progress.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The stages of our data design process are:</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Backlog</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage helps us to understand the planning data landscape.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Screen</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage helps us to verify that a consideration plays an important role in the planning system.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage is intended to help us to understand the planning need for a consideration.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Co-design</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage is focused on us designing the smallest data model that will satisfy the highest number of needs.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Test and iterate</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage helps us to build confidence in the data model, proving it is both feasible and will add value.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Go / no-go</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage helps us to get sign-off for any potential risks we have identified.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prepare for platform</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage is focused on preparing for the productionisation of the dataset(s) for the consideration.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">On the platform</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">At this stage authoritative data will be collected and made available on <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">planning.data.gov.uk</a>.</p>
