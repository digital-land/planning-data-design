    <p class="govuk-body">We’ve created a data design process that is repeatable and modular to produce better and more consistent results. This approach also makes it easier to open up our process for others to contribute and follow.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Our process is split into several stages. We want to make it easy to see where a planning consideration is in our process and what we need to do to make progress.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Each planning consideration we take through the process gives us more information. Measuring what worked, what didn’t work and what needs tweaking helps us make each step more efficient.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">There are 8 stages in total.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">1. Backlog</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage helps us to understand the planning data landscape.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Someone tells us about a subject area (we call these planning considerations) that plays a part in planning decision-making. This can be during the application or plan-making processes. They are expressing an opinion that data for this consideration should be more readily available.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We then add it to the backlog and indicate where we think it fits with our programme objectives.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Once it’s on the backlog, this means we’re committed to looking at this consideration.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="{{ url_for('planning_consideration.considerations', stage='Backlog')}}" class="govuk-link">See planning considerations in the Backlog stage</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">2. Screen</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage helps us to verify that a consideration plays an important role in the planning system.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We answer set questions in the screening stage to help us to understand the legal underpinnings of the consideration, where it is used and needed in the planning system and what, if any, data already exists.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">At this stage, it is usually possible to tell if we can use an existing national dataset or whether a new standard is needed.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="{{ url_for('planning_consideration.considerations', stage='Screen')}}" class="govuk-link">See planning considerations in the Screen stage</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">3. Research</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage is intended to help us to understand the planning need for a consideration.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We answer set questions in the research stage to help us understand the planning and data need.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We capture how and where the considerations are used, the size and scope of any potential data yield, assumed user needs, use-cases for the data and an expectation of who might be able to provide the required data.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This information is essential for data modelling.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="{{ url_for('planning_consideration.considerations', stage='Research')}}" class="govuk-link">See planning considerations in the Research stage</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">4. Co-design</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage is focused on us designing the smallest data model that will satisfy the highest number of needs.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">In the co-design stage we develop a draft data model.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Our approach is to start small and build up. So at this stage we’ll design a data model to capture the fewest data points needed to satisfy the clearest, most important use-cases.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The data model will be co-designed with users: people needing the data, people providing the data and stakeholders.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="{{ url_for('planning_consideration.considerations', stage='Co-design')}}" class="govuk-link">See planning considerations in the Co-design stage</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">5. Test and iterate</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage helps us to build confidence in the data model, proving it is both feasible and will add value.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We take the draft data model and create the specification for it and any supporting materials.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We then test these materials along with the data model in a controlled environment. We do this with potential data providers.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This testing allows us to check the data will work in reality, that it's feasible to produce and provides value.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This stage may lead to changes to the data model.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="{{ url_for('planning_consideration.considerations', stage='Test and iterate')}}" class="govuk-link">See planning considerations in the Test and iterate stage</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">6. Go / no-go</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage helps us to get sign-off for any potential risks we have identified.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We will summarise what we've learnt during the data design process and check off any associated risks.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This is a governance step for <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">planning.data.gov.uk</a></p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="{{ url_for('planning_consideration.considerations', stage='Ready for go/no-go')}}" class="govuk-link">See planning considerations in the Ready for go/no-go stage</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">7. Prepare for platform</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">This stage is focused on preparing for the productionisation of the dataset(s) for the consideration.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We want to make sure everything is in place to move from experimental to production quality data that you can trust.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We wouldn't expect to make any changes to the data model at this point.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We’ll articulate what to expect from an authoritative dataset - for example, who we expect to publish, what we expect them to publish and how often.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="{{ url_for('planning_consideration.considerations', stage='Prepared for platform')}}" class="govuk-link">See planning considerations in the Prepare for platform stage</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">8. On the platform</h2>

    <p class="govuk body">At this stage authoritative data will be collected and made available on <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">planning.data.gov.uk</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Work will shift from designing the data to collecting the data.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Some, less authoritative, data will be on the platform for data consumers to use. Over time we’ll collect more data from the dataset(s), increasing the quality and authority of the available data.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Feedback from providers and consumers will be collected and fed back to the data design team for future iterations of the standard.</p>
