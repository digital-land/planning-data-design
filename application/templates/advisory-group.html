    <p class="govuk-body-l">MHCLG Digital Planning are developing a set of open, reusable data specifications to underpin planning applications. These will make sure the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-application-forms-templates-for-local-planning-authorities" class="govuk-link">current templates</a> are underpinned by data.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The specifications will define the structure and format of data that is required when submitting a planning application based on the national legislation in place.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Our intended outcomes are to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>improve interoperability, accessibility and understanding</li>
      <li>enable integration with existing datasets (for example land use, and infrastructure)​</li>
      <li>foster collaboration among government bodies, developers, planners, software providers​ and everyone else</li>
      <li>improve data flow, quality, consistency and transparency in the planning process</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">We have a challenging timeline to deliver specifications by the end of March 2025. In order for this to be feasible we are aiming for the minimum viable specifications that underpin the current national system.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We are doing this work in the open. To help us we brought together 2 groups:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Advisory group - this group consists of a mix of people from industry including software providers, government bodies, LPAs and other interest groups</li>
      <li>Community group - this group consists of everyone else interested in planning applications and the work we are doing to develop data standards, and is open to all LPAs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="whats-next">What's next</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">We have taken feedback from our advisory group and community and developed a repository of the issues and questions that we have. We are going to work through these issues offline over the next month.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Our next advisory group meeting and drop in session will be focused on closing as many issues as we can to enable us to develop the data models.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The sessions will be held on</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>26th Feb - Advisory group</li>
