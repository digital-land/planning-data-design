    <p class="govuk-body-l">MHCLG Digital Planning are developing a set of open, reusable data specifications to underpin planning applications. These will make sure the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-application-forms-templates-for-local-planning-authorities" class="govuk-link">current templates</a> are underpinned by data.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The specifications will define the structure and format of data that is required when submitting a planning application based on the national legislation in place.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Our intended outcomes are to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>improve interoperability, accessibility and understanding</li>
      <li>enable integration with existing datasets (for example land use, and infrastructure)​</li>
      <li>foster collaboration among government bodies, developers, planners, software providers​ and everyone else</li>
      <li>improve data flow, quality, consistency and transparency in the planning process</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">We have a challenging timeline to deliver specifications by the end of March 2025. In order for this to be feasible we are aiming for the minimum viable specifications that underpin the current national system.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We are doing this work in the open. To help us we brought together 2 groups:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Advisory group - this group consists of a mix of people from industry including software providers, government bodies, LPAs and other interest groups</li>
      <li>Community group - this group consists of everyone else interested in planning applications and the work we are doing to develop data standards, and is open to all LPAs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="whats-next">What's next</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">As of 16 May, the team designing the planning application data specifications will no longer be proactively responding to new comments or feedback. From this point, changes to the component specifications will only be made in response to feedback already received, or if a show-stopping issue comes to light (which we are not anticipating).</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We will then begin working towards mandating the specifications as ‘approved data standards’ under the powers granted by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/55" class="govuk-link">Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023</a> (LURA23). During this period, the specifications are not yet legally mandatory. While we expect no major changes, we cannot guarantee that the specifications will remain entirely static before formal adoption.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">In response to feedback from the advisory group and drop-in sessions, we recognise that software suppliers use a variety of methods and programming languages to ingest specifications. Any defined transfer formats would likely require customisation to fit existing systems, which is standard practice. As such, we are providing the specifications in a human-readable format to support flexible implementation in whichever language or format best suits your setup.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">These <a href="https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification?tab=readme-ov-file#application-types" class="govuk-link">specifications</a> are already available in draft form for review (Reminder: after 16 May, edits will only reflect existing feedback and no further changes will be considered unless they are critical). Testing will begin with the early adopters group, and the specifications will remain publicly accessible for anyone to view and prepare for implementation ahead of mandating.</p>
