There are different ways to contribute to depending on where the planning consideration is in the [data design process]({{ url_for('main.page', page='data-design-process')}}), but you can get involved at any time.

To build a design model, we need as many participants involved as possible.

You can get involved by joining online discussions or coming to events.

### [Help us prioritise what to work on next](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/categories/planning-consideration)

We work in the open with conversations in Github that anyone can view and contribute to.

### [Tell us about a missing dataset](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/29)

If you can't find a dataset you need on our backlog, go to Github to tell us what we're missing. The more you can tell us about the consideration the better.

---

### [Add your own dataset](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-help-develop-a-new-dataset)

Follow our guidance setting out what you need to provide to get the dataset added to the [planning data platform](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/).

### Upcoming events

The data design team hosts events for all LPAs and organisations involved to join. We want as many people as possible to help design datasets that work for everyone.

Our most recent event was an [advisory group](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/advisory-group) on planning application data specifications.
