There are different ways to contribute to depending on where the planning consideration is in the [data design process]({{ url_for('main.page', page='data-design-process')}}), but you can get involved at any time.

To build a design model, we need as many participants involved as possible. 

You can get involved by joining online discussions or coming to events.

### [Tell us about a missing dataset](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/29)

If you can’t find a dataset you need on our backlog, let us know what we’re missing on Github, The more you can tell us about the consideration the better.

### Upcoming events

The data design team hosts events for all LPAs and interested parties to join.  We want as many people involved to design datasets that work for everyone.

We currently have no planned events.
