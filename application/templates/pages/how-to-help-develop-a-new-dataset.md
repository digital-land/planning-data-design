## Check if it’s on the backlog

Firstly, check if the planning consideration relating to your dataset is [on the backlog.](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/)

## What to do if the consideration is on the backlog

If it’s there, then go into the github discussion on that consideration and tell us if you think there’s anything missing.

## What to do if the consideration is not on the  backlog

If it’s not there, then you’ll need to tell us about the planning consideration you have in mind, and explain why you think data for it should be on planning.data.gov.uk. You can do this by [opening a new github discussion.](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/new?category=planning-consideration) The name of the discussion should be the name of the planning consideration you’re talking about.

## What we need to understand

You’ll need to answer these questions about the planning consideration you have in mind:

1. What problem are we trying to solve with this consideration?

Example:

There was no centralised dataset for Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) across different local planning authorities (LPAs). This made it difficult for users to determine whether trees on a site are legally protected.

2. How is it valuable?

Example:

A dataset of TPOs would help planners quickly check restrictions before approving developments. Developers avoid legal issues by knowing which trees are protected.

3. Is it feasible?

Example:

Many LPAs already collect and publish TPO data, but formats varied. Standardising this data and ensuring all LPAs publish in an open format was feasible.

4. Is it actionable?

Example:

By publishing TPOs in a consistent format they were integrated into planning systems, reducing manual checks and errors.

## What you need to think about

1. Strategic alignment

* Does the consideration align with government and agency priorities?
* Is it critical to the success of a high profile project or initiative?


2. User and stakeholder needs

* Which groups (teams, organisations, public, policymakers, businesses) would use this data, and how?
* The more people that need to use the data, the more valuable it is to have on the platform.
* Who would be responsible for producing, maintaining and publishing the data?


3. Data impact and feasibility

* Is the data/information essential to make a planning decision? A planning need could also be about facilitating plantech, landowners and developers. Not just the public decision making.
* Does or should it include spatial data? (Spatial data = high value, harder to obtain)
* What will access to the data enable?
* Does the data currently exist?
* If yes, is it accessible, accurate, and up to date? Is it published under an open licence?
* [planning.data.gov.uk](http://planning.data.gov.uk) is an open data platform, which means that all data that is shared by the platform must be under an open licence. For this to be the case all data put onto the platform must be under an open licence.
* Follow our [guidance](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-get-existing-datasets-on-to-planning-data-gov-uk) setting out what you need to provide to get an existing dataset added to planning.data.gov.uk.
* If no, what effort is required to create it?
* Does the data (or planning consideration) link to any other datasets (or planning considerations)?
* Linked data is more valuable data. For example, anything with a `uprn` means it is possible to piece together more information about the property that `uprn` references.

4. Common fields

Every dataset has a common set of fields, check [how we define a dataset.](https://standards.planning-data.dev/guides/how-we-define-a-dataset/)

5. Governance and maintenance

* Are there privacy, legal, or ethical considerations in using or publishing this data?
* What are the resource, governance, and funding requirements for managing this data long-term?

6. Support

What support do you require from Data Design while you develop the dataset for this consideration?

7. Timelines and delivery

* What are the milestones or deadlines for this planning consideration?
* How long will it take to produce the initial dataset?
* Are there any external dependencies that could affect delivery?
