### Check if it's on the backlog

Firstly, check if the planning consideration relating to your dataset is [on the backlog](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/).

### What to do if the consideration is on the backlog

If it's there, then go into the github discussion on that consideration and tell us what's missing and what data you have. You'll need to give us this information in the thread:

#### 1. Your existing dataset

We need this information about the dataset:

* name
* URL
* description
* licence (planning.data.gov.uk is for open data)
* publishing organisation
* documentation-url

#### 2. Use of the data

The more information you can provide about the consideration and dataset the better. As a minimum we need to know:

* what the planning need is
* use cases for the data

#### 3. Analysing the dataset

Summarise what is in the existing data and provide:

* the number of records
* does it include geospatial data, and if it does:
  * what is the co-ordinate reference system (CRS)
  * provide an image of a sample of the data plotted so we know what it looks like
* a list of all the fields/attributes in a record
* any fields that have a pre-defined set of values (usually type or class fields), list all the values used in the dataset and how many records have that value
* a sample of the data in a table or its GeoJSON equivalent
* how often the data is updated (if known)

### What to do if the consideration is not on the backlog

If it's not there, then you'll need to tell us, and explain why you think data for it should be on planning.data.gov.uk. You can do this by [opening a new github discussion](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/new?category=planning-consideration).
The name of the discussion should be the name of the planning consideration you're talking about, and you'll need to give us this information in the body of the post:

#### 1. Basic information about the consideration

We need to know:

* name of consideration
* description
* legislation (name and link)
* synonyms (if there are any)

#### 2. Your existing dataset

We need this information about the dataset:

* name
* URL
* description
* licence (planning.data.gov.uk is for open data)
* publishing organisation
* documentation-url

#### 3. Use of the data

The more information you can provide about the consideration and dataset the better. As a minimum we need to know:

* what the planning need is
* use cases for the data

#### 4. Analysing the dataset

Summarise what is in the existing data and provide:

* the number of records
* does it include geospatial data, and if it does:
  * what is the co-ordinate reference system (CRS)
  * provide an image of a sample of the data plotted so we know what it looks like
* a list of all the fields/attributes in a record
* any fields that have a pre-defined set of values (usually type or class fields), list all the values used in the dataset and how many records have that value
* a sample of the data in a table or its GeoJSON equivalent
* how often the data is updated (if known)
