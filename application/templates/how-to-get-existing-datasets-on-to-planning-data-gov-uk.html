    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Check if it’s on our backlog</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Firstly, check if the planning consideration relating to your dataset is [on our backlog.](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/)</p>

     <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if the consideration is on our backlog</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">If it’s there, then go into the github discussion on that consideration and tell us what’s missing and what data you have. You’ll need to give us this information in your thread:

####1. Your existing dataset
      
We need this information about the dataset:
      
* name
* URL
* description
* licence (planning.data.gov.uk is for open data)
* publishing organisation
* documentation-url

####2. Use of the data
      
The more information you can provide about the consideration and dataset the better. As a minimum we need to know:
      
* what the planning need is
* use cases for the data

####3. Analysing the dataset
      
Summarise what is in the existing data and provide:
      
* the number of records
* does it include geospatial data, and if it does:
  - what is the co-ordinate reference system (CRS)
  - provide an image of a sample of the data plotted so we know what it looks like
* a list of all the fields/attributes in a record
* any fields that have a pre-defined set of values (usually type or class fields), list all the values used in the dataset and how many records have that value
* a sample of the data in a table or its GeoJSON equivalent
* how often the data is updated (if known)

 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if the consideration is not on our backlog</h3>

If it’s not there, then you’ll need to tell us, and explain why you think data for it should be on planning.data.gov.uk. You can do this by [opening a new github discussion.](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/new?category=planning-consideration) The name of the discussion should be the name of the planning consideration you’re talking about, and you’ll need to give us this information in the body of the post:
    
####1. Basic information about the consideration

We need to know:
    
* name of consideration
* description
* legislation (name and link)
* synonyms (if there are any)

####2. Your existing dataset
      
We need this information about the dataset:
      
* name
* URL
* description
* licence (planning.data.gov.uk is for open data)
* publishing organisation
* documentation-url

####3. Use of the data
      
The more information you can provide about the consideration and dataset the better. As a minimum we need to know:
      
* what the planning need is
* use cases for the data

####4. Analysing the dataset
      
Summarise what is in the existing data and provide:
      
* the number of records
* does it include geospatial data, and if it does:
  - what is the co-ordinate reference system (CRS)
  - provide an image of a sample of the data plotted so we know what it looks like
* a list of all the fields/attributes in a record
* any fields that have a pre-defined set of values (usually type or class fields), list all the values used in the dataset and how many records have that value
* a sample of the data in a table or its GeoJSON equivalent
* how often the data is updated (if known)
